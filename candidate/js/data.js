I am currently a self-employed designer and contractor and live with my girlfriend Lovisa. <br> <br> The organisation I represent, The People’s Choice, is a volunteer led group that seeks to elect community advocates into local government governance. I served as the Environment Sector Chair for the NZLP from 2019 - 2021. This role connected me to community activists, environmental planners and scientists from across the country; so too often we discussed the same topic at our meetings.<br> <br> Climate change <br> As an eastern resident, when I run alongside the Ōtākaro Avon river, I see Bexley returning to the wetland that it once was. I see gulls dropping shellfish on the Pegasus coastline. I also see the rain in the gardens, the flooding in the streets and the clogged up roads.  <br> <br> I succesfully stood at the 2022 Local Government election on my policy platform and the two following questions;<br> <br> a) How best do we include our communities in the decisions that are going to affect our lives in the short term with regard to climate change? <br> <br> b) How can we live more harmoniously with our birds, wetlands and marine life? <br> <br> These are what I base my policy decisions on at the Regional Council.

I'm really enjoying the campaign so far. I reached the milestone of having talked to 500 households yesterday. Overwhelmingly people are friendly and have thoughts on local governance in Christchurch. Community outreach is something important in my opinion to development as a candidate and if successful in the campaign as a politician. We should always keep the community at the forefront of our work and decision making. It seems that sometimes bureacracies in ivory towers seem to forget this. They spend swathes of their time defending our large multi billion institutions against public scrutiny over poor decision making. Often from individuals spending their own time raising issues of public significance. The Bromley sewerage treatment environmental disaster highlights this. I spoke to a resident in South New Brighton yesterday who said that council staff told her that there was no mould growing as a result of the Bromley sewerage facility malfunction. People across the east are finding a black substance growing on their house that has never been seen before. I did some digging to find out what was going on and lo and behold council had determined that the black substance wasn't mould. And it was journalists who'd gotten this information is wasn't a public info release. Thus staff were using orwellian newspeak to disquell this womans fears because she'd approached them and said 'theres mould on my house from Bromley' and they said 'there's no mould from Bromley, its seasonal mould'. Without saying that 'there is an unidentified substance on peoples properties throughout the east that we don't know the cause of'. If Council aren't taking responsibility then ECAN should prosecute them. Plain and simple. The fire was an 'act of god' as we're told, but the fact that the plant was left to fester over summer and autumn wasn't.</a> ",

Sometimes people who are in the later of stages of life say to me, 'I've got no worries, too old to worry about politics, I just go along with it all.' I think this is an interesting sentiment but one that a young mind may not fully appreciate. One could jump to the position that everyone should care about politics and the effect of our democratic institutions and the laws and regulations that they permeate. This seems a rational position particularly to the ideological political operator. I think a less ideological perspective may give one a greater understanding of this sentiment. Perhaps they've fought and struggled through lifes battles to the ultimate bliss that may await one in laying down ones own political ideology. In a sense ones own significance. Or perhaps they just don't want to talk and this is an easy way to hang up the phone. <br> <i class='fa-solid fa-face-grin-tears'></i>",

Ōnuku and the area in its proximity is of significant historical importance as the first place in the South Island where the Treaty of Waitangi was signed and also where in 1998 PM Jenny Shipley apologised to Ngāi Tahu on behalf of the Crown. This was one of the final settlement stages of Te Kerēme; the Ngāi Tahu claim.<br><br> We also went and visited Takapūneke Reserve, between Ōnuku and Akaroa with Pou Tū te Raki o Te Maiharanui recently erected in memory of another nationally significant historical event. Photo below is of Councillor Iaen Cranwell and I at this site. <br><br> In 1830 the 12 man brig, Elizabeth, anchored off the Ngāi Tahu flax-trading settlement of Takapūneke. Elizabeth; flying the British flag and captained by John Stewart, concealed Te Rauparaha and a Ngāti Toa war party on a vengeance mission against Ngāi Tahu. Captain Stewart enticed the Ngāi Tahu Ariki Te Maiharanui aboard the boat with his daughter and later other relatives where they were ambushed and shackled below deck. When night came the Ngāti Toa musketeers landed at Takapūneke and brutally sacked the settlement and butchered and captured the remaining inhabitants.<br><br>John Stewart kept Te Maiharanui in irons on the Elizabeth at Kapiti for weeks until Te Rauparaha delivered the cargo of flax as per their deal. Te Maiharanui was then handed over and ceremoniously tortured to death by the wives and widows of Ngāti Toa chiefs near Ōtaki.<br><br>'The Elizabeth affair was a violent intervention, under the British flag, in a Maori tribal war” and resulted in the Governor of New South Wales, Ralph Darling, appointing James Busby as the inaugural British Resident in New Zealand. The Christchurch City Council's management plan for Takapūneke Reserve states that “Takapūneke is historically significant because there is a direct sequence of events at Takapūneke in 1830 and the acquisition of sovereignty over New Zealand by the British Government in 1840.'<br><br>Akaroa County Council erected a sewerage treatment plant in 1960 at Takapūneke. The Christchurch City Council (the successor to the Akaroa County Council) acknowledges that this was an “act of particular cultural insensitivity”. It will continue to discharge treated wastewater at the site until the Council consents and builds the new Akaroa wastewater scheme.<br><br>Sources<br><br><a href='https://www.facebook.com/councillorjoedavies/posts/pfbid0ZEHe4gnEVfNs7zF4VGx5AwANPs3uebfMwXmy6eyDEq21X8dMdYDAdLSbcdKzXiHKl?notif_id=1668138376493627&notif_t=page_post_reaction&ref=notif'><i class='fa-solid fa-hand-sparkles'></i></a>",
