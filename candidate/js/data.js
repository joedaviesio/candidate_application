    bio: "I grew up in Christchurch after moving from England with my family. My leadership journey began at Linwood College, where I served as head boy during the 2011 earthquakes – an experience that taught me the importance of clear, accurate information during times of crisis. It was also a period that has shaped our city and many of our lives and I find my mind often wondering back to the autumn of 2011.<br><br>My commitment to public service started with my role as a Community Board member at the Christchurch City Council. Since then, I've built a strong foundation in science and technology, which informs my evidence-based approach to decision-making. I apply these skills in design and studies. Having a Bachelors of Science in Environmental Science and health science qualifications from ARA.<br><br> During my 2022-2025 term on the Canterbury Regional Council, I've prioritised data-driven solutions as Public Transport Core Service Lead. By focusing on quality information and research, we've made meaningful progress on service uplifts including Route 7 connecting Queenspark to the city on a high frequency corridor, dogs on buses, and expanded rural services. I will continue advocating for the CHRT Rangiora Rolleston passenger rail line (see www.chrt.space).<br><br> My environmental work has focused on water protection through wetland restoration. I've championed increased funding for biodiversity projects and eco sanctuaries, successfully working to secure the $1 million biodiversity targeted rate in Christchurch and advancing the redzone consents up the Avon River corridor to enhance our waterway ecosystems. I am also Chair of the Avon Heathcote Estuary Trust.<br><br>My belief that quality information leads to better decisions has driven my work in digital democracy. We've transformed council transparency through live-streamed meetings and improved public access to decision-making processes, established the Canterbury Artificial Intelligence Working Group, and updated our delegations manual.",

    bio_x: "2025-08-25 <br><br>There has to be three priorities for the next council; <br><br>We have to protect Christchurch’s aquifers, we have to safeguard Christchurch’s drinking water. <br><br>We have to support our buses, our trains, we have to support public transport. <br><br>We have to increase flood protection funding.<br><br>It's been a good period in the campaign getting out and talking to the people of east Christchurch and what they think about the council and the election.<br><br>The water conversations are often in relation to chlorination and the work going on the Avon corridor, a hundred million dollar multi generational project connecting Brighton to the city in a natural pocket of native and introduced species up the Avon Otakaro. It's been great that environmental consents have been granted to the city in many of these projects. <br><br>Further north - the 1 million dollar biodiversity targeted rate has been partially spent into the regional estate - 10,000 hectares of land up the Waimakariri for flood protection that over time the region has invested more into plantings, native protection and biodiversity. We have a 40% increase to our regional park maintenance budget through this Councils long term plan and Tutehounuku Korako and I have begun the process of the development of a Kowhai Regional Park in Kaikoura. <br><br>We have had investments into Te Rauakaaka, our reserve at the opening to Brooklands lagoon. I have chaired the Avon Heathcote Estuary Trust as we have transitioned the Mother of All Clean ups project to the Community Waterways Partnership and built stronger relations with Te Ihutai Ahuwhenua Trust. I have also moved a policy regarding crown purchase of nutrient hotspot farms for quick land and water use change, through the New Zealand Labour Party, that has proceeded through our regional conference to the national policy council for review. <br><br>I was informed yesterday that the NZLP policy council have decided not to progress taking the remit to national conference, which is a decision I will seek to understand better to progress the nutrient issue in Labour. <br><br>There is a storm hanging over regional government in New Zealand with ongoing resource management reform led by Minister Bishop. The next council has to show calm, grace and sensibility headed into conversations with the government and has to do so in the best interests of Canterbury and Christchurch's ratepayers while putting the protection of our awa and environment into practise.<br><br>"

    text: "12 weeks until voting papers go out. Getting into a crucial period of the campaign when things start heating up and people start declaring and political posturing begins. I'm really enjoying the campaign so far. I reached the milestone of having talked to 500 households yesterday. Overwhelmingly people are friendly and have thoughts on local governance in Christchurch. Community outreach is something important in my opinion to development as a candidate and if successful in the campaign as a politician. We should always keep the community at the forefront of our work and decision making. It seems that sometimes bureacracies in ivory towers seem to forget this. They spend swathes of their time defending our large multi billion institutions against public scrutiny over poor decision making. Often from individuals spending their own time raising issues of public significance. The Bromley sewerage treatment environmental disaster highlights this. I spoke to a resident in South New Brighton yesterday who said that council staff told her that there was no mould growing as a result of the Bromley sewerage facility malfunction. People across the east are finding a black substance growing on their house that has never been seen before. I did some digging to find out what was going on and lo and behold council had determined that the black substance wasn't mould. And it was journalists who'd gotten this information is wasn't a public info release. Thus staff were using orwellian newspeak to disquell this womans fears because she'd approached them and said 'theres mould on my house from Bromley' and they said 'there's no mould from Bromley, its seasonal mould'. Without saying that 'there is an unidentified substance on peoples properties throughout the east that we don't know the cause of'. If Council aren't taking responsibility then ECAN should prosecute them. Plain and simple. The fire was an 'act of god' as we're told, but the fact that the plant was left to fester over summer and autumn wasn't.</a> ",

Sometimes people who are in the later of stages of life say to me, 'I've got no worries, too old to worry about politics, I just go along with it all.' I think this is an interesting sentiment but one that a young mind may not fully appreciate. One could jump to the position that everyone should care about politics and the effect of our democratic institutions and the laws and regulations that they permeate. This seems a rational position particularly to the ideological political operator. I think a less ideological perspective may give one a greater understanding of this sentiment. Perhaps they've fought and struggled through lifes battles to the ultimate bliss that may await one in laying down ones own political ideology. In a sense ones own significance. Or perhaps they just don't want to talk and this is an easy way to hang up the phone. <br> <i class='fa-solid fa-face-grin-tears'></i>",

Ōnuku and the area in its proximity is of significant historical importance as the first place in the South Island where the Treaty of Waitangi was signed and also where in 1998 PM Jenny Shipley apologised to Ngāi Tahu on behalf of the Crown. This was one of the final settlement stages of Te Kerēme; the Ngāi Tahu claim.<br><br> We also went and visited Takapūneke Reserve, between Ōnuku and Akaroa with Pou Tū te Raki o Te Maiharanui recently erected in memory of another nationally significant historical event. Photo below is of Councillor Iaen Cranwell and I at this site. <br><br> In 1830 the 12 man brig, Elizabeth, anchored off the Ngāi Tahu flax-trading settlement of Takapūneke. Elizabeth; flying the British flag and captained by John Stewart, concealed Te Rauparaha and a Ngāti Toa war party on a vengeance mission against Ngāi Tahu. Captain Stewart enticed the Ngāi Tahu Ariki Te Maiharanui aboard the boat with his daughter and later other relatives where they were ambushed and shackled below deck. When night came the Ngāti Toa musketeers landed at Takapūneke and brutally sacked the settlement and butchered and captured the remaining inhabitants.<br><br>John Stewart kept Te Maiharanui in irons on the Elizabeth at Kapiti for weeks until Te Rauparaha delivered the cargo of flax as per their deal. Te Maiharanui was then handed over and ceremoniously tortured to death by the wives and widows of Ngāti Toa chiefs near Ōtaki.<br><br>'The Elizabeth affair was a violent intervention, under the British flag, in a Maori tribal war” and resulted in the Governor of New South Wales, Ralph Darling, appointing James Busby as the inaugural British Resident in New Zealand. The Christchurch City Council's management plan for Takapūneke Reserve states that “Takapūneke is historically significant because there is a direct sequence of events at Takapūneke in 1830 and the acquisition of sovereignty over New Zealand by the British Government in 1840.'<br><br>Akaroa County Council erected a sewerage treatment plant in 1960 at Takapūneke. The Christchurch City Council (the successor to the Akaroa County Council) acknowledges that this was an “act of particular cultural insensitivity”. It will continue to discharge treated wastewater at the site until the Council consents and builds the new Akaroa wastewater scheme.<br><br>Sources<br><br><a href='https://www.facebook.com/councillorjoedavies/posts/pfbid0ZEHe4gnEVfNs7zF4VGx5AwANPs3uebfMwXmy6eyDEq21X8dMdYDAdLSbcdKzXiHKl?notif_id=1668138376493627&notif_t=page_post_reaction&ref=notif'><i class='fa-solid fa-hand-sparkles'></i></a>",

The major theme of the plan is to hold levels of service steady to the Long Term Plan, with reprioritization, ‘austerity’ in the words of Cllr Mackenzie. ‘Financial prudence’. <br> <br>The major debate was over Cllr Edge’s (Nth Canterbury), amendment to the recommended increased rates by 0.32% to prioritise an additional $500,000 dollars to the Waitaha Action to Impact fund. This is a segment from my debate speech; <br> <br>“I will be supporting the amendments of Councillor Edge. By maintaining Me Uru Rakau funding, thought I note without an amendment, and by increasing the available funding for the Waitaha Action to Impact fund we will be putting a clear signal out to the region that this Council, despite economic headwinds, maintains our current support for the regeneration of our natural environment, on the ground, in the community and that we have heard the feedback themes regarding biodiversity from our engagement process.' <br> <br> The amendment was ‘Not Carried’ with the following voting record. <br> <br> For: Moved Cllr Edge (Nth Cant), Seconded Cllr Vicki Southworth (Sth Chch), Cllr Greg Byrnes (Central Chch), Cllr Paul Dietchse (Sth Chch), Cllr Davies (NE Chch), Deputy Chair Pauling (W Chch), Cllr Robinson (Central Chch). <br> <br>Against: Chair Scott (Sth Cant), Cllr Tutehounuku Korako (Ngai Tahu), Cllr Mackenzie (Mid Cant), Cllr Sunckell (Mid Cant), Cllr McKay (Nth Cant), Cllr David East (NE Chch), Cllr Swiggs (W Chch), Cllr Ward (Sth Cant). <br> <br>Abstention: Cllr Iaean Cranwell (Ngai Tahu). <br> <br>While I’m personally disappointed by the result; it was a fulsome debate and it's important for our chambers of elector representatives to be public facing arenas of policy, ideas and democracy.

By 2050 at current rates we will likely have more than 700,000 residents (30% more than we do now) in the Greater Christchurch city sub region. <br><br>As a result of this the Whakawhanake Kainga Komiti / Urban Growth Partnership for Greater Christchurch was formed (2022) in order to provide coordinated Government approach and planning. <br><br>Committee / Komiti<br><br>Canterbury Regional Council (3 voting members)<br><br>Mana whenua (3 voting members)<br><br>Christchurch City Council (3 voting members)<br><br>Selwyn District Council (3 voting members)<br><br>Waimakariri District Council (3 voting members)<br><br>Te Whatu Ora (1 member) <br><br> Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency (1 non-voting member)<br><br>Ministers appointed by Cabinet (2 members currently Megan Woods and Nanaia Mahuta). <br><br>Plan<br><br>The Greater Christchurch Spatial Plan is currently out for consultation and has an overriding spatial strategy and policy directions to address this urban growth. Here are some of the key takeaways.<br><br>1) Current housing development is moving out and not up. Ideally we need demand to move from quarter acre blocks in Selwyn and Waimakariri to an intensified urban corridor serviced by mass rapid transit (MRT) from Belfast to Hornby, running through the City Centre. <br><br>2) MRT will replace cars on roads including Papanui and Riccarton. It will be as fast as car travel times and run a turn up and go model. The stops along the way will have medium/high intensification and pedestrian/cycle access, completely reforming the urban form of this current route. <br><br>3) Hornby is forecast to become a sub regional centre second only in population and economy to the city centre. This is because of its strategic location to the west of the city and the proximity to the airport. “There is the opportunity for regeneration and significant brownfield redevelopment to enhance its urban form, support community integration, and provide a stronger and more integrated centre core with the transition of surrounding areas from industrial to high density residential (50 to 100 households per hectare).”<br><br>4) Christchurch’s Central City “..remains economically vulnerable. About 40,000 people now work in the Central City, which is below pre-earthquake levels and is particularly low compared with the 115,000 people working in the central business districts of Auckland and Wellington.” <br><br>5) The two places mentioned in the East of the City Sub Region are Linwood and Shirley which are “Locally important urban centres and towns”.<br><br>6) There is a policy drive within the whole plan that looks at coastal hazards, changing weather, increased biodiversity, creating a green belt and ‘avoiding’ levels of urban development in the east, particularly on the coast. While we may feel we’re missing out in the east, I personally believe that we’re developing anyway and that if the plan is followed there may be an opportunity to preserve our character and enhance our natural features. And that this may lead to economic opportunities. The growing west will also contribute to its GDP (I.e He Puna Tai Moana, Sumner beach, QEII and other attractions + economic opportunities for those living and spending in the east and working in the west). <br><br>7) Legislation including the Town and Country Planning Act 1953 and the Resource Management Act 1991 have zoned Maori Reserves as Rural - “preventing subdivision, housing, social and educational infrastructure and the development” of some economic activities. “Partnership and work between mana whenua and councils is needed to remove residual planning barriers to the development of Māori Land in the Papakāinga / Kāinga Nohoanga Zone in the Christchurch District Plan and the proposed Special Purpose (Kāinga Nohoanga) Zone in Waimakariri.”<br><br>Submission <br><br>1) I support the system and the direction that the plan is taking Greater Christchurch. I would however support having some form of comment and door opening to future connections from the city region to North/Mid/South Canterbury. <br><br>2) I have asked for clarification on the Plans inclusion of the Avon Heathcote Estuary / Ihutai.<br><br><a href='https://greaterchristchurch.org.nz/urbangrowthprogramme/draft-greater-christchurch-spatial-plan/'><i class='fa-solid fa-hand-sparkles'></i> Make your own submission.</a>",

It outlined Mountfort's Gothic stone chamber that took a hammering in 2011.<br><br>An older couple approached one of the wooden doors of the original timber-on-stone structure. The yellow earthquake sticker, now bleached white from ten years of exposure to the elements, indicated the building was earthquake prone with only 20% structural confidence.<br><br>The gentleman pulled the large iron handle and they entered the building, the door shutting behind them with a thud and spray of dust as though they'd been sealed into a hidden realm. I stopped, quickly realising I couldn't follow them inside. I brushed away some grass from the faded golden sign stating 'public viewings on Saturday from 10:30 - 15:30' and waited to see what would happen.<br><br>A moment later, the door reopened and an engineer in a hard hat and orange vest ushered the tourist couple back onto Durham Street North. The gentleman protested that the sign said it was open. It was a funny and light moment reflecting the sparkling autumn Chch day and introduced myself to the engineer, mentioning I would be visiting next Friday with ECan. She replied that she and her colleague would be guiding us. ",
