    bio: "I was born in England and moved to Christchurch with my parents. I attended Mt Pleasant Primary school and then Linwood College where I was head boy through the 2011 earthquakes. I have served as a Community Board member at the CCC and have gone on to gain qualifications in health sciences and technology. I am currently a self-employed designer and contractor and live with my girlfriend Louisa. <br> <br> The organisation I represent, The People’s Choice, is a volunteer led group that seeks to elect community advocates into local government governance. I served as the Environment Sector Chair for the NZLP from 2019 - 2021. This role connected me to community activists, environmental planners and scientists from across the country; so too often we discussed the same topic at our meetings.<br> <br> Climate change <br> As a South New Brighton resident, when I run alongside the Ōtākaro Avon river, I see Bexley returning to the wetland that it once was. I see gulls dropping shellfish on the Pegasus coastline. I also see the rain in the gardens, the flooding in the streets and the clogged up roads.  <br> <br> I am asking for your support in this election and I invite you to consider two important questions; <br> <br> a) How best do we include our communities in the decisions that are going to affect our lives in the short term with regard to climate change? <br> <br> b) How can we live more harmoniously with our birds, wetlands and marine life? <br> <br> If I’m successfully elected, I will base policy decisions on these questions.",

    text: "12 weeks until voting papers go out. Getting into a crucial period of the campaign when things start heating up and people start declaring and political posturing begins. I'm really enjoying the campaign so far. I reached the milestone of having talked to 500 households yesterday. Overwhelmingly people are friendly and have thoughts on local governance in Christchurch. Community outreach is something important in my opinion to development as a candidate and if successful in the campaign as a politician. We should always keep the community at the forefront of our work and decision making. It seems that sometimes bureacracies in ivory towers seem to forget this. They spend swathes of their time defending our large multi billion institutions against public scrutiny over poor decision making. Often from individuals spending their own time raising issues of public significance. The Bromley sewerage treatment environmental disaster highlights this. I spoke to a resident in South New Brighton yesterday who said that council staff told her that there was no mould growing as a result of the Bromley sewerage facility malfunction. People across the east are finding a black substance growing on their house that has never been seen before. I did some digging to find out what was going on and lo and behold council had determined that the black substance wasn't mould. And it was journalists who'd gotten this information is wasn't a public info release. Thus staff were using orwellian newspeak to disquell this womans fears because she'd approached them and said 'theres mould on my house from Bromley' and they said 'there's no mould from Bromley, its seasonal mould'. Without saying that 'there is an unidentified substance on peoples properties throughout the east that we don't know the cause of'. If Council aren't taking responsibility then ECAN should prosecute them. Plain and simple. The fire was an 'act of god' as we're told, but the fact that the plant was left to fester over summer and autumn wasn't.</a> ",

Went for a run in the stark landscape/grassland of the St James conservation area that borders the Molesworth (NZ's largest station). It's worth remembering that the Regional Council covers the entire Canterbury Province so from north beyond this photo of Maukuratawhai, to way down south past Mt Cook and the Mackenzie district. Its a huge area of varied environments, conditions and human settlements. Christchurch is the population centre of the region and South Island and as such has a majority of members on the Regional Council. Despite this it is essential for us as candidates and potential Regional Councillors to learn, observe and understand the environment in areas outside of our residence.",

Sometimes people who are in the later of stages of life say to me, 'I've got no worries, too old to worry about politics, I just go along with it all.' I think this is an interesting sentiment but one that a young mind may not fully appreciate. One could jump to the position that everyone should care about politics and the effect of our democratic institutions and the laws and regulations that they permeate. This seems a rational position particularly to the ideological political operator. I think a less ideological perspective may give one a greater understanding of this sentiment. Perhaps they've fought and struggled through lifes battles to the ultimate bliss that may await one in laying down ones own political ideology. In a sense ones own significance. Or perhaps they just don't want to talk and this is an easy way to hang up the phone. <br> <i class='fa-solid fa-face-grin-tears'></i>",

They have so much to bring to the governance of the Regional Council. On that note I have to mention Brynlea Stocks our candidate in Central/Ohoko who will bring an entirely new lense to the role as a representative of Gen Z. The grassroots of a political organisation are just like our sports clubs and our environmental volunteer groups. The People's Choice are powered by community activists that work together and share our knowledge and networks. That's why we're such a strong electoral organisation in NZ local government. ",
